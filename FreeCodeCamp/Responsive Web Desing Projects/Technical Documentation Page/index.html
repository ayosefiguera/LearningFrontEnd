                <article class="doc__content">
                    <p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several
                        variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.)
                        Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.</p>
                    <p>To begin with, make a local copy of our oojs.html file. This contains very little — a
                        &#60;script&#62; element for us to write our source code into.We'll use this as a basis for
                        exploring basic object syntax. While working with this example you should have your developer
                        tools
                        JavaScript console open and ready to type in some commands.</p>
                    <p>As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing
                        a
                        variable. Try entering the following line below the JavaScript code that's already in your file,
                        then saving and refreshing:</p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                        <code>
    const person = {};
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Now open your browser's JavaScript console, enter person into it, and press Enter/Return. You
                        should
                        get a result similar to one of the below lines:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">

                    <code class="doc__code ">
    [object Object]
    Object { }
    { }      
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>
                        Congratulations, you've just created your first object. Job done! But this is an empty object,
                        so we
                        can't really do much with it. Let's update the JavaScript object in our file to look like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    const person = {
        name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
        age: 32,
        gender: 'male',
        interests: ['music', 'skiing'],
        bio: function() {
            alert(this.name[0] + ' ' + this.name[1] + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old. He likes ' + this.interests[0] + ' and ' + this.interests[1] + '.');
        },
        greeting: function() {
            alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');
        }
        };
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        After saving and refreshing, try entering some of the following into the JavaScript console on
                        your
                        browser devtools:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.name
    person.name[0]
    person.age
    person.interests[1]
    person.bio()
    person.greeting()
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>You have now got some data and functionality inside your object, and are now able to access them
                        with
                        some nice simple syntax!</p>
                    <div class="doc__note">
                        <p>Note: If you are having trouble getting this to work, try comparing your code against our
                            version
                            — see oojs-finished.html (also see it running live). The live version will give you a blank
                            screen, but that's OK — again, open your devtools and try typing in the above commands to
                            see
                            the object structure.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        So what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple members, each of which has a
                        name
                        (e.g. name and age above), and a value (e.g. ['Bob', 'Smith'] and 32). Each name/value pair must
                        be
                        separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon. The syntax
                        always follows this pattern:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    const objectName = {
        member1Name: member1Value,
        member2Name: member2Value,
        member3Name: member3Value
        };
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>
                        The value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our person object we've got a
                        string,
                        a number, two arrays, and two functions. The first four items are data items, and are referred
                        to as
                        the object's properties. The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something
                        with
                        that data, and are referred to as the object's methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An object like this is referred to as an object literal — we've literally written out the object
                        contents as we've come to create it. This is in contrast to objects instantiated from classes,
                        which
                        we'll look at later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series
                        of
                        structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be
                        put
                        into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items
                        individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual
                        items by name.
                    </p>

            <section class="doc main-section" id="Dot_notation">

                    <p>
                        Above, you accessed the object's properties and methods using dot notation. The object name
                        (person)
                        acts as the namespace — it must be entered first to access anything encapsulated inside the
                        object.
                        Next you write a dot, then the item you want to access — this can be the name of a simple
                        property,
                        an item of an array property, or a call to one of the object's methods, for example:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.age
    person.interests[1]
    person.bio()
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <h3 class="doc__subtitle">Sub-namespaces</h3>

                    <p>It is even possible to make the value of an object member another object. For example, try
                        changing
                        the name member from</p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
                        name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>to</p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    name : {
        first: 'Bob',
        last: 'Smith'
        },
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>Here we are effectively creating a sub-namespace. This sounds complex, but really it's not — to
                        access these items you just need to chain the extra step onto the end with another dot. Try
                        these in
                        the JS console:</p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.name.first
    person.name.last
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>Important: At this point you'll also need to go through your method code and change any instances
                        of
                    </p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    name[0]
    name[1]
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>to</p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    name.first
    name.last
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>Otherwise your methods will no longer work.</p>

                <article class="doc__content">
                    <p>There is another way to access object properties — using bracket notation. Instead of using
                        these:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.age
    person.name.first

                </pre>
                    <p>You can use</p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person['age']
    person['name']['first']
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        This looks very similar to how you access the items in an array, and it is basically the same
                        thing
                        — instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with
                        each
                        member's value. It is no wonder that objects are sometimes called associative arrays — they map
                        strings to values in the same way that arrays map numbers to values.

                <article class="doc__content">
                    <p>So far we've only looked at retrieving (or getting) object members — you can also set (update)
                        the
                        value of object members by declaring the member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation),
                        like this:</p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.age = 45;
    person['name']['last'] = 'Cratchit';
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>Try entering the above lines, and then getting the members again to see how they've changed, like
                        so:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.age
    person['name']['last']
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        Setting members doesn't just stop at updating the values of existing properties and methods; you
                        can
                        also create completely new members. Try these in the JS console:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person['eyes'] = 'hazel';
    person.farewell = function() { alert("Bye everybody!"); }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        You can now test out your new members:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person['eyes']
    person.farewell()
                    </code>
                </pre>

                        One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set not only member values
                        dynamically, but member names too. Let's say we wanted users to be able to store custom value
                        types
                        in their people data, by typing the member name and value into two text inputs. We could get
                        those
                        values like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    let myDataName = nameInput.value;
    let myDataValue = nameValue.value;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>We could then add this new member name and value to the person object like this:</p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person[myDataName] = myDataValue;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>To test this, try adding the following lines into your code, just below the closing curly brace
                        of
                        the person object:</p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    let myDataName = 'height';
    let myDataValue = '1.75m';
    person[myDataName] = myDataValue;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        Now try saving and refreshing, and entering the following into your text input:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    person.height
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        Adding a property to an object using the method above isn't possible with dot notation, which
                        can
                        only accept a literal member name, not a variable value pointing to a name.

                <article class="doc__content">
                    <p>You may have noticed something slightly strange in our methods. Look at this one for example:</p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    greeting: function() {
        alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name.first + '.');
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        You are probably wondering what "this" is. The this keyword refers to the current object the
                        code is
                        being written inside — so in this case this is equivalent to person. So why not just write
                        person
                        instead? As you'll see in the Object-oriented JavaScript for beginners article, when we start
                        creating constructors and so on, this is very useful — it always ensures that the correct values
                        are
                        used when a member's context changes (for example, two different person object instances may
                        have
                        different names, but we want to use their own name when saying their greeting).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's illustrate what we mean with a simplified pair of person objects:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    const person1 = {
        name: 'Chris',
        greeting: function() {
            alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name + '.');
        }
        }
        
        const person2 = {
        name: 'Deepti',
        greeting: function() {
            alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name + '.');
        }
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this case, person1.greeting() outputs "Hi! I'm Chris."; person2.greeting() on the other hand
                        outputs "Hi! I'm Deepti.", even though the method's code is exactly the same in each case. As we
                        said earlier, this is equal to the object the code is inside — this isn't hugely useful when you
                        are
                        writing out object literals by hand, but it really comes into its own when you are dynamically
                        generating objects (for example using constructors). It will all become clearer later on.

                <article class="doc__content">
                    <p>
                        As you've been going through these examples, you have probably been thinking that the dot
                        notation
                        you've been using is very familiar. That's because you've been using it throughout the course!
                        Every
                        time we've been working through an example that uses a built-in browser API or JavaScript
                        object,
                        we've been using objects, because such features are built using exactly the same kind of object
                        structures that we've been looking at here, albeit more complex ones than in our own basic
                        custom
                        examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So when you used string methods like:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    myString.split(',');
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        You were using a method available on an instance of the String class. Every time you create a
                        string
                        in your code, that string is automatically created as an instance of String, and therefore has
                        several common methods and properties available on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you accessed the document object model using lines like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    const myDiv = document.createElement('div');
    const myVideo = document.querySelector('video');
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        You were using methods available on an instance of the Document class. For each webpage loaded,
                        an
                        instance of Document is created, called document, which represents the entire page's structure,
                        content, and other features such as its URL. Again, this means that it has several common
                        methods
                        and properties available on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same is true of pretty much any other built-in object or API you've been using — Array,
                        Math,
                        and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that built in objects and APIs don't always create object instances automatically. As an
                        example, the Notifications API — which allows modern browsers to fire system notifications —
                        requires you to instantiate a new object instance using the constructor for each notification
                        you
                        want to fire. Try entering the following into your JavaScript console:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="doc__pre">
                    <code>
    const myNotification = new Notification('Hello!');
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    <p>
                        Again, we'll look at constructors in a later article.
                    </p>
                    <div class="doc__note">
                        Note: It is useful to think about the way objects communicate as message passing — when an
                        object
                        needs another object to perform some kind of action often it sends a message to another object
                        via
                        one of its methods, and waits for a response, which we know as a return value.

                    <p>Congratulations, you've reached the end of our first JS objects article — you should now have a
                        good
                        idea of how to work with objects in JavaScript — including creating your own simple objects. You
                        should also appreciate that objects are very useful as structures for storing related data and
                        functionality — if you tried to keep track of all the properties and methods in our person
                        object as
                        separate variables and functions, it would be inefficient and frustrating, and we'd run the risk
                        of
                        clashing with other variables and functions that have the same names. Objects let us keep the
                        information safely locked away in their own package, out of harm's way.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the next article we'll start to look at object-oriented programming (OOP) theory, and how
                        such
                        techniques can be used in JavaScript.
